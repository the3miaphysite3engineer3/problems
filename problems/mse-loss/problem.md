Compute the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between predictions and targets:
$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

where $y_i$ represents the predictions, $\hat{y}_i$ represents the targets, and $N$ is the total number of elements.

## Input:
- Tensor `predictions` of arbitrary shape $S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_n$
- Tensor `targets` of the same shape as predictions
- `shape`: Array containing the dimensions of the input tensors
- `ndim` ($n$): Number of dimensions in the input tensors

## Output:
- Scalar `output` containing the mean squared error loss

## Notes:
- The input tensors are stored in row-major order
- The MSE loss is a scalar value that represents the average squared difference between predictions and targets
- This implementation should handle tensors of arbitrary shapes
- For numerical stability, consider intermediate steps carefully

## Test Case Sizes

- shape=(4096, 4096)
- shape=(8192, 8192)
- shape=(512, 512, 512)
- shape=(64, 64, 64, 64)
- shape=(32, 32, 32, 32, 32)
