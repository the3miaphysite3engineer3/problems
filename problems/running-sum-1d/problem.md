Calculate 1D running sum with fix sized sliding window:
$$
\text{output}[i] = \sum_{j=0}^{W-1} \text{input}[i + j]
$$

The running sum operation slides the window over the input data and computing the sum for each window. Zero padding is used at the boundaries.

## Input:
- Vector $\text{input}$ of size $\text{N}$ (input data)

## Output:
- Vector $\text{output}$ of size $\text{N}$ (output sums)

## Notes:
- $\text{W}$ is odd and smaller than $\text{N}$
- Use zero padding at the boundaries where the window extends beyond the input data
- The window is centered at each position, with $(W-1)/2$ elements on each side

## Test Case Sizes

- N=65536, W=8191
- N=32768, W=8191
- N=131072, W=8191
- N=524288, W=8191
