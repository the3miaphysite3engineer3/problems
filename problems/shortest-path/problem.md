Find the shortest path distances from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted directed graph.

Given a weighted adjacency matrix $A$ of size $N \times N$ with integer weights and a source node $s$, compute the shortest distances from $s$ to all nodes:

$$
d[v] = \min_{path\ from\ s\ to\ v} \sum_{(u,w) \in path} A[u][w]
$$

## Input
- Weighted adjacency matrix $A$ of size $N \times N$ where $A[i][j]$ contains the integer weight of the edge from node $i$ to node $j$, and $A[i][j] = 0$ if no edge exists
- Source node index $s$

## Output
- Array $d$ of size $N$ containing shortest distances from source $s$ to all nodes. If a node is unreachable, its distance should be $-1$.

## Test Case Sizes

- n = 512
- n = 2048
- n = 4096
- n = 6144
- n = 8192
