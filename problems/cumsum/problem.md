Compute the cumulative sum (also known as prefix sum or scan) of an input array:
$$
\text{output}[i] = \sum_{j=0}^{i} \text{input}[j]
$$

The cumulative sum at each position is the sum of all elements up to and including that position.

## Input:
- Vector $\text{input}$ of size $\text{N}$

## Output:
- Vector $\text{output}$ of size $\text{N}$ containing cumulative sums

## Notes:
- The first element of the output is equal to the first element of the input
