Perform min reduction over a specified dimension of an input tensor:
$$
\text{output}[i_1,\ldots,i_{d-1},1,i_{d+1},\ldots,i_n] = \min_{i_d=0}^{S_d-1} \text{input}[i_1,\ldots,i_d,\ldots,i_n]
$$

where $d$ is the dimension to reduce over, $n$ is the number of dimensions, and $S_d$ is the size of dimension $d$.

## Input:
- Tensor `input` of arbitrary shape $S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_n$
- `dim` ($d$): Dimension to reduce over (0-based indexing)
- `shape`: Array containing the dimensions of the input tensor
- `ndim` ($n$): Number of dimensions in the input tensor

## Output:
- Tensor `output` with shape $S_1 \times \cdots \times S_{d-1} \times 1 \times S_{d+1} \times \cdots \times S_n$
  - The reduced dimension is kept with size 1 (keepdim=True)

## Notes:
- The input tensor is stored in row-major order
- The reduction should maintain numerical stability by using appropriate accumulation techniques
- The output tensor preserves the dimensionality of the input tensor with the reduced dimension having size 1
- This problem is adapted from [KernelBench](https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench/blob/main/KernelBench/level1/53_Min_reduction_over_a_dimension.py)

## Test Case Sizes

- shape=(16, 128, 256), dim=1
- shape=(32, 512, 512), dim=0
- shape=(8, 1024, 1024), dim=2
- shape=(64, 128, 128, 128), dim=2
- shape=(4, 256, 256, 256), dim=1
- shape=(128, 64, 64, 64), dim=3
